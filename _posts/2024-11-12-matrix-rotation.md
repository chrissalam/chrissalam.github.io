title: matrix rotation
---

I used to be very afraid of a matrix question. I now view it as a bit of a gift, as it's a highly visual format, and graphs and trees are a little harder to mentally parse. But the matrix has some options to it that it simply helps you to know. i.e. Matrix rotation is pretty difficult to write a raw algorithm for but does it help you know that rotation is the same as transposing and then inverting each row? I think that only helps if you know exactly what transposing is. Let's start there.
