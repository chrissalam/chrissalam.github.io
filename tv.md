I have had a host of dynamic and interesting experiences stemming primarily from being an immigrant and chosing to be in places where minority immigrants either aren't or aren't expected to have agency. 

At the moment, I am focusing at the moment on a project at based on my experiences at the Domes in UC Davis, a cooperative I lived when I was in graduate school at UC Davis, prior to the time when the Solar Community Housing Assoication (SCHA) managed the grounds. I'm working on this project with two close friends from the time, Cat Callaway and Johnny Orozco. Our fringe realities in a college fringe and the characters we have created from inspiration from those times will be eventually filmed onsite at the now SCHA managed <a href="http://schadavis.org/the-domes">Domes.</a>

I'm working on other ideas involving my experiences as a petroleum engineer in Bakersfield, a factory farm engineer across the United States, being born and greatly influenced by being born in Malaysia as a racial minority under a quota system and of course, my pelicular hometown, Victorville.
